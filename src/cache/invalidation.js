/**
 * invalidation rules — ONE source of truth. YOUR JOB.
 *
 * Every write that changes a cached read must DEL the key(s) it affects.
 * Keeping all the rules here (not scattered across controllers) is what
 * stops invalidation from drifting as the app grows.
 *
 * Wire these up so that:
 *   - creating a post  clears the cached feed
 *   - editing a user   clears THAT user's cached profile (only that one)
 *
 * NOTE on the feed: if your feed key includes params (page, sort), a single
 * `redis.del("posts:feed")` won't cover every page. Decide how to handle it
 * and write your reasoning in the README. DO NOT use `redis.keys("posts:feed:*")`
 * in production — KEYS blocks single-threaded Redis. Use one of:
 *   - a fixed, un-paginated feed key (simplest for this scaffold), or
 *   - a version counter in the key (INCR on write), or
 *   - an explicit dependency list of live feed keys.
